Optimization of Real-Time Multiple Face Detection on Intel速 Xeon速 Scalable Processors 
 
With the processing power of new Xeon速 Family (former name "Cascade Lake"), optimized Intel速 compiler and MKL-DNN library, for the first time, it's possible for us to archieve real-time multiple human face detection while tring to detemine the owner's gender, age and even face rank(just for entainment) WITHOUT using any GPU or hardware accelerators.
This demo system is powered by 4x XEON-8280L processors with a consumer grade USB Camera.
